Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are legal requirements to meet depending on the size and type of business, spread across the provinces and federal departments including of course, the Canada Revenue Agency since hopefully the business will make money. Recently, the Canada.ca User Experience team xxx a team with Industry Canada and Canada Revenue Agency to improve online access and service to Canadians starting a business. We started with user needs and worked through from end to end.  

## Topic pages fill the cracks between departments 

One of the important service objectives for Canada.ca is to xxxxx - and topic pages play a key role. Topic pages bring together all of the service tasks onto one page, across federal departments. They act almost as a ‘home page’ for that set of services. If you are a mariner for example, the [Marine Transportation topic page](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/transport/marine.html) on Canada.ca  shows tasks from 7 different departments, from navigating to licensing to pollution. 

Topic pages all look the same because they are based on a template outlined in the Content and IA spec. Over time, some parts of the topic page template have been improved as user research, usually task-based usability testing with Canadians, has highlighted problems. But on the whole, there has only been the one template available, with some optional pieces. When the team started the optimization project, the start a business topic page looked like this: 
![Starting a business page back in October with publications regulations and random ordered topics](./images/Starting_topic_Oct2016_567x523.png "Starting a business topic page in October 2016")

And here it is afterward - [Live version of Starting a business topic page on Canada.ca]  (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/start.html)

One of the first things we noticed in our user research is that entrepreneurs considering starting a business were often at different phases in their familiarity in the process. Some entrepreneurs knew exactly what they wanted to do, for example, just get a business number and operate provincially or incorporate with the federal government. Others were daunted by all the decisions and wondered if they needed to hire an accountant to dig through the rules and options.

These decisions were complicated by the different government priorities. Industry Canada was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with tax accounts, provinces with their own incorporation or permits. How could we bring it all into one process?

The sequential topic page focused on ensuring entrepreneurs could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, with the security that they weren't forgetting something
2. Understand which steps they could ignore and which were relevant to them, if they had already started the process somewhere else
3. Skip all the process pages and jump to the specific applications and registrations they needed

To do this, we made a single column of links, each of them numbered. We needed to reduce some of the options to make it cleaner. Instead of having guides, business plans and before starting a business, we gave a single link to business planning. In contrast, choosing a business name was added, as a prerequisite to the other registration steps. A lot of the specific things entrepreneurs are trying to do are still available through the most requested links to the right.

Under each step though, there were decisions that entrepreneurs had to make, some of them with long term consequences for their taxes and business structure. Added difficulty could come from the many different organisations, both public and private sector that would offer various steps, often in competition with each other.
