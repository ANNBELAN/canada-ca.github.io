Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are legal requirements to meet depending on the size and type of business, spread across the provinces and federal departments including of course, the Canada Revenue Agency since hopefully the business will make money. Together with Industry Canada and Canada Revenue Agency, the TBS User Experience Optimization Team set out to improve online access and service to Canadians starting a business. We started with user needs and worked through from end to end.  

## Topic pages fill the cracks between departments 

Canada.ca exists to provide better online service to Canadians for their top tasks and topic pages play a key role. Many people don't know or care which department offers a particular service. Topic pages bring together all of the service tasks onto one page, across federal departments. They act almost as a ‘home page’ for that set of services. If you are a mariner for example, the [Marine Transportation topic page](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/transport/marine.html) on Canada.ca shows tasks from 7 different departments, from navigating to licensing to pollution. 

Topic pages have a consistent look based on a template outlined in the Content and IA spec. Over time, some parts of the topic page template have been improved as user research, usually task-based usability testing with Canadians, has highlighted problems. But on the whole, there has only been the one template available, with some optional pieces. When the team started the optimization project, the start a business topic page looked like this:

## Starting with user needs
One of the first things we noticed in our user research on starting a business was that Canadians considering who came to the topic page were often at different phases in their familiarity with the process. Some entrepreneurs knew exactly what they wanted to do, such as get a business number and operate provincially or incorporate with the federal government. Others were daunted by all the links and content, often looking for a checklist to try to avoid missing something important.

Only 67% of the participants in our baseline test could identify essential legal steps to start a business. Some even confided in us that when they started their own business, they would probably have to hire an accountant or lawyer.

Unfortunately, starting a business is pretty complex. To register, an entrepreneur not only has to know which questions to ask, but they have to understand the threshholds, risks and limitations the options.

For a small business making less than $30k per year, accidentally registering for a GST/HST number means they'll be required to add a 10% tax charge on all their sales that they otherwise wouldn't have had to charge. Deciding to incorporate a business could mean more paperwork, fees and accountants for a small business that could operate effectively as a sole proprietorship. Conversely, getting off the ground with a sole proprietorship could end up in fewer options to get start-up funding and higher personal financial risk for some.

These processes are further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. Industry Canada was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with GST and corporate tax accounts, provinces with their own incorporation or permits. How could we bring it all into one process - particularly when the sequence wasn't clear even to us?

To develop our own understanding of what entrepreneurs would need, the project team mapped out the different decisions they had to make when starting their business.

## From user needs to design requirements
It was clear that just dropping the tasks with the highest traffic at the top of the page wasn't going to cut it. Canadians simply didn't know where to look for the registration that was right for them, and with so many links on the Starting a business page, they went off in all directions. 

When an entrepreneur came to the topic page, we needed to make sure they could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting or missing something
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed



The main role of government in starting a business is to support those legal steps - steps like registering the business, choosing a name that didn"t already exist, getting a business number and opening GST and payroll accounts. 


## Conveying the sequence and understanding it ourselves
The steps required to start a business weren't clearly laid out on the topic page - 





To do this, we made a single column of links, each of them numbered. 

Identifying the steps, sometimes involved pruning the options. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, parts of the process had to be added to the page. Choosing a business name is a step all businesses have to go through, whether incorporating federally or provincially or just getting a business number. In the past, however, the website just included it in the bucket of links under business registration.
