THIS ARTICLE IS A DRAFT - IT IS NOT FINISHED!!

Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are legal requirements spread across the provinces and federal departments that depend on the size and type of business. Together with Innnovation Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the Canada.ca team at TBS set out to improve the experience for Canadians starting a business via Canada.ca. The team started by exploring the user journey through the government requirements. The decisions identified in that journey were turned into tasks for a usability study with Canadians on the baseline Canada.ca site. We held a series of design sprints, testing design prototypes with Canadians as we went and measuring improvements against the baseline data.   

The new designs went live in the Business menu on Canada.ca in March 2017. After a few months, we measured the impact on the flow of web visitors. One of the big changes the team made was to bring the important step of 'Choosing a business name' up onto the Starting a business page, and to streamline the route to the name search page. The conversion funnel below shows the successful outcome. In the 2 month period before the optimization, only 10 people made it from the Starting a business page to the name search target. In the 2 months afterwards, over 1,200 people took the simplified path to that important page.

## Discovering where to start
Unfortunately, starting a business is complex. An entrepreneur has to know where to start, and they have to understand the sequence and implications of their decisions. Building this understanding is further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. Corporations Canada is interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, the Canada Revenue Agency wants to make sure business get Business numbers, GST and corporate tax accounts, and the provinces have their own incorporation and permit processes. While the web pages delivered to those needs, the team focused on the needs of the people starting a business in Canada. 

Needs of the entrepreneurs: 
1. Deal with one government-requirement decision at a time, in the right order, feeling secure that they weren't missing something 
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed

We mapped out the different decisions and the sequence of the government requirements when starting a business. As we explored,  we noticed that decisions around choosing a business name had to be made before taking almost any of the government registration steps. Evidence from research with Canadians also highlighted that some of the decisions and the sequences that were particular pain points for people.

The map helped us design a series of steps to meet the needs of the entrepreneurs.  Designing the steps sometimes involved pruning options that were displayed prominently on the existing pages. Steps had to be stand-alone and clearly differentiated from other steps. To that end, we removed the many links to guides, business plans and checklists, so that the first step was a single link to Planning a business. 

In contrast, choosing a business name had surfaced as a crucial step but there was no link at all on the Start a business topic page in the baseline design. That made it extremely difficult for our research participants to find it unless they dove into registration pages. 
>Only 37% of our baseline test participants (students studying business) were able to successfully find a search to check if their business name idea was already taken. 

## Direct outcomes for Canadians starting a business

The team prototyped new designs based on the research evidence and our flow map,and tested with more Canadians during the design process. We surfaced 'Choosing a name' as a step in Starting a business, and designed a sequence to skip directly through the layers of government sites like NUANS to the search pages. We updated the link labels using the acronym 'NUANS' to the clearer title 'Search name' and the 'order [a NUANS report] now' link was sidestepped completely, so that people could search without worrying that they had to place an order first. Once all the various pieces of the new design came together, we launched another usability testing research study with a similar set of business students. 
>Success at the 'Find out if a name is taken' task rose from 37% to 94% success in our task-based studies
