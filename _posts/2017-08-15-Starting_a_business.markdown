Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and itâ€™s not an easy one. There are varying legal requirements to meet, depending on the size and type of business, spread across the provinces and federal departments. Together with Innnovation Science and Economic Development Canada and Canada Revenue Agency, the TBS User Experience Optimization Team set out to improve online access and service to Canadians starting a business. We started with user needs and worked through from end to end.  

## People wonder "What is the first thing I have to do?" 
THIS ARTICLE IS A DRAFT - IT IS NOT FINISHED!!

One of the first things we noticed in our user research was that Canadians considering staring a business were often at different phases in their familiarity with the process. Some entrepreneurs knew exactly what they wanted to do, such as get a business number and operate provincially or incorporate with the federal government. Others were daunted by all the links and content available to them, often looking for a checklist to try to avoid missing something important.

Only 67% of the participants in our baseline test could identify essential legal steps to start a business. Some even confided in us that when they started their own business, they would probably have to hire an accountant or lawyer.

Unfortunately, starting a business is pretty complex. To register, an entrepreneur not only has to know which questions to ask, but they have to understand the threshholds, risks and limitations the options.

For a small business making less than $30k per year, accidentally registering for a GST/HST number means they'll be required to add a 10% tax charge on all their sales that they otherwise wouldn't have had to charge. Deciding to incorporate a business could mean more paperwork, fees and accountants for a small business that could operate effectively as a sole proprietorship. Conversely, getting off the ground with a sole proprietorship could end up in fewer options to get start-up funding and higher personal financial risk for some.

These processes are further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. Industry Canada was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with GST and corporate tax accounts, provinces with their own incorporation or permits. How could we bring it all into one process - particularly when the sequence wasn't clear even to us?

To develop our own understanding of what entrepreneurs would need, the project team mapped out the different decisions they had to make when starting their business.

Wow! There's a lot for entrepreneurs to consider.

## From pain points to user needs

To manage this complexity, we needed to make sure entrepreneurs could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting or missing something
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed

Identifying the steps, sometimes involved pruning the options. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, choosing a business name is a crucial step to registering many businesses. This wasn't even present on the start a business topic in the past, found only when Canadians went to registration pages.
