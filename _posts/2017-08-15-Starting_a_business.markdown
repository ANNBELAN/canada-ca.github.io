THIS ARTICLE IS A DRAFT - IT IS NOT FINISHED!!

Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and it’s not an easy one. There are legal requirements spread across the provinces and federal departments that depend on the size and type of business. Together with Innnovation Science and Economic Development Canada and Canada Revenue Agency, the Canada.ca product team at TBS set out to improve Canada.ca's online service to Canadians starting a business. The team started with discovery of pain points on the journey through the complete set of government processes, and a baseline set of task success measurements. We held a series of design sprints to address the pain points, testing design prototypes with Canadians as we went and measuring improvements against the baseline results.   

The new designs went live in the Business menu on Canada.ca in March 2017. After a few months, we measured the impact on the flow of web visitors. One of the big changes the team made was to bring the important step of 'Choosing a business name' up onto the Starting a business page, and to streamline the route to the name search page. The conversion funnel below shows the successful outcome. In the 2 month period before the optimization, only 10 people made it from the Starting a business page to the name search target. In the 2 months afterwards, over 1,200 people took the simplified path to that important page.

## Discovering decision and pain points
Unfortunately, starting a business is complex. An entrepreneur has to know where to start, and they have to understand the sequence and implications of their decisions. Building this understanding is further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. Corporations Canada is interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, the Canada Revenue Agency wants to make sure business get Business numbers, GST and corporate tax accounts, and the provinces have their own incorporation and permit processes.

We mapped out the different decisions and the sequence of the government requirements when starting a business. As we explored,  we noticed that decisions around choosing a business name had to be made before taking almost any of the government registration steps. Evidence from research with Canadians also highlighted that some of the decisions and the sequences were causing problems for people and for the government departments trying to serve them.

## Exploring design options
To manage the complexity revealed in our map, we needed to make sure entrepreneurs could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, in the right order, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting or missing something 
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed

Designing the steps sometimes involved pruning options that were displayed prominently on the existing pages. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having links to guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, choosing a unique business name had surfaced as a crucial step but wasn't even linked on the Start a business topic page when we began, making it extremely difficult for our research participants to find it unless they dove into registration pages. 
>Only 37% of our baseline test participants (students studying business) were able to successfully find a search to check if their business name idea was already taken. 

## Direct outcomes for Canadians starting a business

The team prototyped new designs based on the research evidence and our flow map,and tested with more Canadians during the design process. We surfaced 'Choosing a name' as a step in Starting a business, and designed a sequence to skip directly through the layers of government sites like NUANS to the search pages. We updated the link labels using the acronym 'NUANS' to the clearer title 'Search name' and the 'order [a NUANS report] now' link was sidestepped completely, so that people could search without worrying that they had to place an order first. Once all the various pieces of the new design came together, we launched another usability testing research study with a similar set of business students. 
>Success at the Find out if a name is taken task rose from 37% to 94% success in our studies
