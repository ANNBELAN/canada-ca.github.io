THIS ARTICLE IS A DRAFT - IT IS NOT FINISHED!!

Starting a business is a top task for Canadians and itâ€™s not an easy one. There are legal requirements spread across the provinces and federal departments that depend on the size and type of business. Together with Innnovation Science and Economic Development Canada and Canada Revenue Agency, the TBS User Experience Optimization Team set out to improve online access and service to Canadians starting a business. Canada.ca brings together tasks across federal departments and agencies, so we started with discovery of pain points on user journeys through the complete set of government processes and worked to resolve them.  

## Where to start and what to do next
Unfortunately, starting a business is complex. An entrepreneur not only has to know where to start, but they have to understand the sequence and implications of their starting points. These processes are further complicated by the different priorities of government agencies. Industry Canada was interested in helping people who wanted to incorporate federally, CRA with Business numbers, GST and corporate tax accounts, and the provinces with their own incorporation or permits. We needed to bring it all together into one process - even thought the sequence wasn't clear, even to us.

(DELETE? Lovely but not contributing to this particular story) In addition, people have to understand the threshholds, risks and limitations of all of the options. Deciding to incorporate their business could mean more paperwork, fees and accountants for a small business that could operate effectively as a sole proprietorship. Conversely, getting off the ground with a sole proprietorship could end up in fewer options to get start-up funding and higher personal financial risk for some. For someone just starting out selling online who will make less than $30k per year, accidentally registering for a GST/HST number means they'll be required to add a 10% tax charge on all their sales that they otherwise wouldn't have had to charge. 

To develop our own understanding of what entrepreneurs would need, the project team mapped out the different decisions they had to make and the sequence required for the government steps when starting their business.  Highlighted below is the step of Choosing a business name, which wasn't even present on the original Starting a Business page, but turned out to be fundamental to progressing through the rest of the sequence.

Just making this map took a lot of investigation, despite the team's extensive expertise in their respective subject areas. 

## From pain points to decision steps

To manage this complexity, we needed to make sure entrepreneurs could:
1. Deal with one decision at a time, in the right order, feeling secure that they weren't forgetting or missing something 
2. Understand which steps they might have done already and which were relevant to them, since many don't do all the steps with one government or agency
3. For those entrepreneurs who had one task, we wanted to make sure they weren't forced to read everything and could get to the specific application they needed

Identifying the steps sometimes involved pruning the options. Steps have to be stand-alone and simple enough to differentiate from other steps. To that end, instead of having links to guides, business plans and before starting a business, step 1 became a single link to business planning. 

In contrast, choosing a unique business name surfaced as a crucial step to registering many businesses, both provincially and federally. Choosing a name wasn't even linked on the Start a business topic page when we began, so our future entrepreneur research participants only found it when they dove into registration pages. 
>Only 37% of our baseline test participants (students studying business) were able to successfully find a search to check if their business name idea was already taken. 

## Direct outcomes for Canadians starting a business

The team prototyped new designs based on the research evidence and our flow map,and tested with more Canadians during the design process. We surfaced 'Choosing a name' as a step in Starting a business, and designed a sequence to skip directly through the layers of government sites like NUANS to the search pages. We updated the link labels using the acronym 'NUANS' to the clearer title 'Search name' and the 'order [a NUANS report] now' link was sidestepped completely, so that people could search without worrying that they had to place an order first. Once all the various pieces of the new design came together, we launched another usability testing research study with a similar set of business students. 
>Success at the Find out if a name is taken task rose from 37% to 94% success in our studies 

After the new designs went live on the Canada.ca site, we validated the outcomes through changes in the web analytic traffic.  It was immediately clear that getting to the business name search from Canada.ca was easier and more obvious than before. Adding the link as a step and reducing the number of clicks,  hugely increased the number of people getting to the search for a unique name from the Starting a business page:
