Every government institution should have a complete understanding of the tasks they support. In managing Canada.ca, we want to understand the top tasks across the entire government. To help with that, we've compiled a [top task list for the Government of Canada](). 

The Government of Canada supports an incredibly wide list of tasks. Government departments and agencies have to manage all of these. Looking at Canada.ca as a whole, we need to focus on the tasks used by most people. If we understand these top tasks, we can refine content, information architecture, and functionality to make them easier to achieve. 
 
## The government-wide top task list
 
In 2013, we began working towards a more centralized web presence for the Government of Canada. While some people know which department provides a service, most don’t know or care. It doesn't always make sense to organize services and information by the department that provides them. By focusing on tasks instead of departments, we can organize content based on what people are actually looking for. 

This work resulted in an initial list of top tasks across the government. We used that list to help design the themes that organize Canada.ca content. The list was updated in 2015, and this most recent update continues on from those efforts. 
 
For this round, we began by collecting top tasks from theme lead institutions. (These are the government departments or agencies that were assigned to manage one or more Canada.ca themes.) Then we extended the request to other institutions who had tasks on the previous lists. 
 
## What we collected

The core information we collected included:

### The institution's top tasks
 
Some institutions had already conducted exercises to determine their top tasks. For others, we asked them to consider a variety of sources:

* Departmental plans
* Mandate letters (from the Prime Minister to cabinet ministers)
* web analytics
* feedback or call centre reports
* stakeholder input
* past research or surveys

By reviewing these sources and carefully analyzing the results, institutions could identify all of the tasks they support for the public. 
 
### Where people "start" the task
 
In previous versions of the list, we found that some tasks seemed to have an unusually high number of visits. This might be because there were a lot of pages associated with a task, or because the task involved a search interface that reported separately for every search result. To avoid complications from these issues, we instead focused on the page where most people tend to start the task. 

### A sense of the traffic
 
Once we have a start page, we wanted to get a sense of how much traffic the page gets. This isn't necessarily a strong indicator of how important a task is. It's possible that something is a top task, but people have a hard time finding it. 

### Search terms people use to get to the task
 
Search logs provide a view into what people are thinking when they visit a website. They also show how often people look for particular things. If you can tell what terms people used to get to the top tasks, then you can refine the related content to make that path even easier for people. 

See [Search-Log Analysis: The Most Overlooked Opportunity in Web UX Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-log-analysis/) for tips on why and how to analyze search log data.

### Top requests to call centres

Call centres get to talk directly to the people using government services. If we know what issues the call centre hears about, we get a good sense of what’s important to people.  

Again, just because an issue comes to a call centre a lot doesn’t mean it’s a top task. For example, one of the most common questions Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada gets is whether dogs are allowed on the [Central Experimental Farm](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/offices-and-locations/central-experimental-farm/?id=1170701489551). Important information for some, but not a top task for the department. 
 
### Proportion of mobile visits
 
We have a good view of how many people are visiting Canada.ca with mobile devices, but not how that proportion varies from task to task. This data provides a useful view into where some tasks remain solidly on the desktop, and which tend to be accessed more through mobile devices.

## Analyzing the results
 
Once we had the data, it was just a matter of digging through to make the list. A big part of this work was identifying a core task and its supporting sub-tasks. 

For example, “Get a passport” is a popular task. There might be a lot of tasks behind that. It  could include things like “renew a passport”, “see passport photo requirements”; even down to “download the passport renewal form". If you were working on the passport content, then you’d want to keep track of all of these tasks. But for our government-wide view, “get a passport” is enough. 
 
We wrote each task as a verb, to make clearer what people are trying to do. We could have simply used "Canadian passports", but wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?"
 
That doesn't necessarily mean that this is how you should write link labels on your site! “Passports” is a perfectly good navigation label to use to bring people to the section of the site where they can do everything about passports - including getting one. 

We collected hundreds of tasks, but picked out 100 of the most visited tasks to make the current top task list. 
 
## Next steps
 
We're already using the list to help us plan and prioritize upcoming task-based optimization projects. It also feeds into overall Canada.ca optimization, both at the theme level and above. We want to keep this list evergreen, constantly refining it as we learn more about what people are coming to Canada.ca to do. To that end, we’ll continue to collect this data from institutions across government. 
 
We also want to help institutions collect and manage their own top tasks. Most institutions have a good idea of the content they produce, often down to the page level. But they may not always be sure that the content is actually supporting a task. The next phase of our work will be to help institutions in collecting and tracking their own tasks so they can be used to manage their content.
