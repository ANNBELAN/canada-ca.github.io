In 2012, the Government of Canada began working towards a more centralized web presence. The vision for Canada.ca is to make it easier for Canadians to find what they are looking for, whichever department or agency might provide it. 

Here's a look at the research and testing we did to tackle the challenge of designing the site's information architecture and navigation.

## Themes: bridges across the thousand islands

While some people know which department provides a service, many don’t know or care. As each department and agency maintains a website of their own, there hasn't been a single online window where a Canadian could find all government services.

The taxonomy couldn't just be a list of the names of the islands or departments. They had to say what you could do there and reflect what citizens were trying to do.

Building a bridge is not a simple process. We took 5 steps just to come up with the taxonomy and many more that you can find linked in separate articles at the bottom of the post to support the design and top tasks. 

The steps taken in 2013 are still being revisted and refined today as we update the list of top tasks and continually improve classification and labelling of top tasks in themes and topics.

### Step 1: List our top tasks

The first thing we did was to develop a list of the most in-demand tasks that citizens undertook with the federal government. Based on web traffic data, collected from all the major departments and agencies, we created a list of the top 100 tasks.

### Step 2: Card sort with stakeholders

In June of 2013, we card sorted the top tasks with internal stakeholders.

Based on the card sort, we came up with a proposal of 15 subject-based themes, such as taxes or immigration, that would form the main navigation for canada.ca.

In addition to the themes, there were a few other labelling needs identified in the card sort that were proposed for the taxonomy.
- a grouping of tasks oriented towards public servants
- administrative categories for contact information, departments and agencies
- audiences
- news 

At the time of the card sort, there were still plans to put all these labels at the top level of Canada, with a single label on top of the 15 themes.

### Step 3: Tree test with Canadians

The taxonomy was updated and validated based on tree testing with Canadians.

29 task scenarios were developed, asking test participants where they would find a top task, such as where to find the guide for tax forms for the current year or where to obtain a boat licence.

There were 3 different versions of the information architecture tested so that we could compare their results.

The findings of the tree testing were:
1) Themes and topics were the most intuitive part of the information architecture. For all but 3 tasks, the participants who used themes and topics were able to find a good a good destination.
2) That we needed to really respect the mental models of canadians and do more validation testing rather than relying on internal card sorting. Testing clearly indicated that for 5 of the 29 tasks, there was another theme that was either better or as likely a place to look for that task.
3) There was no user centric way of putting the themes under a first level word. Each of the 3 tests tried a different variant, including "topics", "information about..." and "about Canada", but these labels made it harder to find the topics, leading to high failure rates for many tasks.
4) General audience labels could not be shown at the same level as themes. The test where audiences were hidden under a top level label "Services for..." was 6% more successful than when audiences were displayed.
5) A lot of Canadians know the department and agency that provides a service, so we can't conceal departments and agencies under the "government" section of the information architecture.
6) This type of tree validation testing was invaluable and we needed to do more of it.

Based on this evidence, we were able to make some final updates before launch, including moving the themes to the very first level of the information architecture and removing audiences from the site's primary navigation.

### Step 4: More tree testing with Canadians

One of our findings from the tree testing was that we needed to do more. We wanted to validate 
- the decision we took to prioritise the themes above the other types of navigation 
- the decision to hide half of the themes under a more services button
- the themes that top tasks were placed under to ensure they aligned with mental models

We set up this second tree jack study in September 2014 with three different versions. 

Once again, we tested themes, this time with 4 versions:
1) Services and Government at the 1st level
2) 7 themes at the 1st level and 8 under More services
3) All themes at the 1st level
4) All themes at the 1st level + a government label

The findings confirmed that the themes at the top level of the IA approach as crucial to findability. It also showed that there were very similar success scores between the More services and All themes approaches.
