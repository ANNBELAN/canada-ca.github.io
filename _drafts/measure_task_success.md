Task success is a critical measurement for Canada.ca. Over the years, success rates for most top tasks have been measured in moderated task-based scenario research studies with Canadians.  As we conducted these studies across the vast scope of Canada.ca, we realized that we needed a new way to break down task success to make the results actionable for the right teams. Canada.ca is laid out in a tree of themes and topics - for example, the Taxes theme contains 8 high-level topics, including Income tax, GST and Payroll. Participants performing tax tasks either navigate or search through those layers of theme and topics to reach one or more target pages where they can complete the task by derivign the correct answer. To help the Theme team assess the success of the navigation layers, we broke out a Findability success rate. 

Findability = measure of whether the participant reached the target page(s) designed for the task, either via search or navigation
Task Completion = measure of whether the participant derived the correct solution to the task, either on the target page or on another page. 

Coding Success and Findability separately gives more latitude to be accurate and consistent in our coding, especially when people search to find the answers. You have to come to terms that Search is a valid way to find answers – with the health tasks, we know most people arrive via Google, so clearly, it is valid. 

Assessing Findability: Target pages - declare them up front before testing, when designing the task scenario, like registering a hypothesis. Should reflect the page *designed* to answer the task. 

Assessing Task completion: this includes GUESSING – have to look at the non-target page found, see why they selected the correct answer- if the content doesn’t actually address the task ,then it’s a guess and a fail.
 
Therefore there are 4 possibilities that address your scenarios below:
Findability | Completion | Example
--- | --- | ---
Success | Success |  Person found a target page and derived the correct answer
Success | Failure |  Person found the target page but failed to derive the correct answer
Failure | Success |  Person failed to find the target but found & derived the correct answer elsewhere on the site
Failure | Failure |  Person failed to find target or answer

So if the Guide has the content that does help them understand and derive the correct answer, the task is successful, but the findability is not.
