Task success is a critical measurement for Canada.ca. Over the years, success rates for most top tasks have been measured in moderated task-based scenario research studies with Canadians.  As we conducted these studies across the vast scope of Canada.ca, we realized that we needed a new way to break down task success to make the results actionable for the right teams. Canada.ca is laid out in a tree of themes and topics - for example, the Taxes theme contains 8 high-level topics, including Income tax, GST and Payroll. Participants performing tax tasks either navigate or search through those layers of theme and topics to reach one or more target pages where they can complete the task by derivign the correct answer. To help the Theme team assess the success of the navigation layers, we broke out a Findability success rate. 

Findability = measure of whether the participant reached the target page(s) designed for the task, either via search or navigation
Task Completion = measure of whether the participant derived the correct solution to the task, either on the target page or on another page. 

Findability | Completion | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
Success | Success |  Found a target page and derived the correct answer
Success | Failure |  Found a target but didn't derive the answer
Failure | Success |  Didn't find a target but did find & derive correct answer elsewhere on the site
Failure | Failure |  Didn't find target or an answer

Coding Success and Findability separately gives more latitude to be accurate and consistent in our coding, especially when people search to find the answers. Findability requires that the team declare target pages prior to the testing for a particular task scenario. The path and the target pages are usually the ones designed to hold the answer to the task, although in some cases, the design may not have been well-thought-out prior to testing. In a sense, the team is stating and pre-registering their hypothesis about the path to successfully completing the task.

Examples: for 

Coding task completion is somewhat simpler once findability is broken out. If the person is on the target page, and derives the correct answer (which in many cases just requires reading), they're coded as correct. On non-target pages though, the coding requires a little more work if the participant chooses the correct answer. Usually we review the video to see if the page they had reached does directly answer the task, in which case they are coded as successful. More often, the page they find doesn't address the answer in enough detail, and people just guess the correct answer, which we code as a task completetion failure.
