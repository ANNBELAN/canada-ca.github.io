## The government-wide top task list
 
In 2013, we began working towards a more centralized web presence for the Government of Canada. While some people know which department provides a service, most donâ€™t know or care. It doesn't always make sense to organize services and information by the department that provides them. By focusing on tasks instead of departments, we can organize content based on what people are actually looking for. 

This work resulted in an initial list of top tasks across the government. We used that list to help design the themes that organize Canada.ca content. The list was updated in 2015, and this most recent update continues on from those efforts. 
 
For this round, we began by collecting top tasks from theme lead institutions. (These are the government departments or agencies that were assigned to manage one or more Canada.ca themes.) Then we extended the request to other institutions who had tasks on the previous lists. 

To learn more about how we manage top tasks on Canada.ca, see [getting the top tasks for the Government of Canada]().
