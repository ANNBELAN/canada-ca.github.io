In 2012, the Government of Canada began working towards a more centralized web presence. The vision for Canada.ca was to make it easier for Canadians to find what they were looking for, whichever department or agency might provide it. Here's the research and testing we did to tackle the challenge of designing the site's structure that you see reflected in its main navigation.

## Themes: bridges across the thousand islands

While some people know which department provides a service, many donâ€™t know or care. As each department and agency maintains a website of their own, there wasn't a single online window where a Canadian could find all government services. 
 
There were a lot of steps involved in building the steps.

### Step 1: Build a list of our top 100 tasks

The first thing we did when planning Canada.ca was to develop a list of the 100 most in-demand tasks that citizens undertook with the federal government. In 2013, we worked with departments and agencies to collect and analyze as much web traffic data as we could to create an inventory of top 100 Government of Canada tasks.

To learn more about the top 100 tasks, see [Top task management on Canada.ca]().

### Step 2: Card sort with stakeholders

In June 26, we card sorted the top tasks with internal stakeholders to come up with a preliminary list of about 20 categories to organize Canada.ca content. 

After analysis and consultation, we proposed an 
- initial set of 15 subject-based themes, such as taxes or immigration that would form the main navigation for canada.ca and the mortar to build bridges between departmental websites and tasks.

In addition to the themes and topics, there were also two more structures that came out of the card sort,
- 1 based on administrative categories like media or contact information
- 1 based on audiences like indigenous peoples or seniors

### Step 3: Tree test with Canadians

Coming up with the themes was only the first step, both for the taxonomy and the navigation on Canada.ca.

We next did a tree test with 848 citizens to validate the theme and topic structure as well as the other structures that came out of the card sort. 

The card sort demonstrated the value of a subject-based approach and allowed us to simplify the navigation proposal. We were able to take out layers in our initial tree around audiences and about government as they didnt help citizens choose where to click.

### Step 4: Building out the rest of the navigation tree

As we decided on the themes, we started to create the rest of the navigation tree. Each topic had to be a keyword for citizens to find the next step towards their task. This was something we continued to validate with tree tests.

As each topic would also reflect the various perspectives and services government had related to its label name, we brought in departments with knowledge of the services and policies government had in those areas to build the taxonomies of the themes most related to their departments.

### Step 5: User interface test

In addition to taxonomy testing, we also built page and navigation designs to help guide Canadians through their journey.

One of our principles was to make it while also giving them the chance to offramp to most requested tasks and explore more about government policy or opportunities to provide feedback.

*Insert graphic on sections of the topic page - perhaps similar to the IP one Manu made? Maybe use a mobile view?*
*or screen grabs of the initial prototypes - might be in the usability testing report*

Then, we invited Canadians to try finding the top tasks in these new designs. 

We built simple prototypes of two different options for themes and did usability testing with 30 citizens. From this, we were able to generate a new design which was used for the initial launch of Canada.ca in December 2013, and is still in use today.

## Ongoing testing

Our research and testing on themes and navigation have only increased since Canada.ca was first launch and we will continue to refine the navigation model.

*Testing results from various rounds, iterative decisions made?*

<!-- moved all the search stuff out, should be a separate article on search -->

## Optimizing tasks

After 4 years, many of the bridges of topics and search are now in place and we're now shifting our focus to end-to-end task improvements.
