Over the last few months, the product design team at TBS has been working on improving specific top tasks on Canada.ca. Here's how we are tackling these projects by working with content owners in Government of Canada departments.

## What is a Canada.ca optimization project?

Canada.ca optimization projects are aimed at improving existing digital services for citizens. Working in a short product cycle, our team collaborates with GC institutions to test and improve specific aspects of high-demand online services and information.

To keep things feasible and focused, for now optimization projects tend to concentrate on the first steps that citizens would take - when they are finding their task and getting started with it. As we build up our experience working on optimization, we anticipate tackling deeper digital service issues in the future.

## The process

The basic process for optimization projects involves five steps:

1. **Discovery** - behavioural research to identify core tasks, develop hypotheses and finalize testing scenarios
2. **Baseline test** - moderated usability testing sessions with participants performing the scenarios on the existing site
3. **Design and prototyping** - a series of sprints to build prototypes that tackle issues uncovered during baseline testing
4. **Validation test** - moderated usability testing with participants performing the scenarios on the prototypes
5. **Launch** - if the validation test shows a measurable improvement, the prototypes are then integrated into production and released at the earliest opportunity.

Timing-wise, the first four steps usually take place in a 3-4 month period. Timing for the final launch step varies depending on the platform being used for production and the institution's publishing process.

## Collaboration

Throughout the process, we ensure close collaboration between the TBS team and the institution. For the duration of the project, we act together as one team through frequent face-to-face contact - meetings, workshops, etc. 
<!--- can someone add more deets here, want to emphasize that we do optimization with institutions rather than doing it to them --->

## Usability testing is key

You'll notice that two of the steps in the process involve moderated usability testing. In fact, usability testing is key to the success of the entire project.

Through moderated usability testing, we are attempting to accomplish two things:

 - measure improvements in terms of task findability and task completion
 - leverage evidence to guide our improvement activities.

In terms of measuring improvements, we are aiming to achieve a noticeable increase in participants' ability to both find and complete the tasks. Usually, this means something in the range of 10 to 20 percentage points when comparing the baseline testing results to the validation round, depending on where the baseline sits. It's a lot easier to go from from 50% to 70% task success in a single project than it is to go from 70% to 90%. 

Within each optimization project, the insights that the team gains from observing usability testing and analyzing the data feed directly into the design phase. It's only once the baseline testing is completed that we actually know what to focus on in terms of building the prototypes.

The insights drawn from usability testing are also to improve the overall design system for Canada.ca. We're always looking for patterns in the issues that the testing uncovers, and when we spot a trend, we work on updating our design manuals to address them. You'll see evidence of this in updates to the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification (link) and Canada.ca Content Style Guide (link).

## There's more to come

To date we have undertaken two Canada.ca optimization projects, and we're working on more. We'll be writing up our experiences with these activities in future articles, so stay tuned for more!
