Criteria for search success

Building bridges between departments

Contextualisation





Theme navigation is not the only bridge across departments.

In his book “Don’t Make Me Think”, Steve Krug mentioned the similarities between a store and a website.

Just as customers in a store might follow aisle signs or ask for help, website visitors use both navigation and search to find their tasks:

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Navigation and search" src="/images/nav-and-search_700x215.png"> *jennifer said she could take photos we can use, if we need (old photos in the deck were just internal from google and I can't find anything for reuse - there might be in stock photography?)*

Asking for help in a store is often a method of last resort. Likewise, Canadians will often go to search when they can't find something on the page. In government, this often happens when tasks from one department can't be found on another department's website despite the closely related nature of the tasks.

In 2013 *not actually sure of the timelines here*, a Government of Canada wide search was implemented. Departments and agencies still have the option of contextualising results to their web content, but Canadians have the option to see results from across government.

Of course, the real challenge for search is only beginning. We're now working with themes and departments to make sure that top search phrases give relevant results, written clearly so they can be differentiated from similar results. We're also trying to improve the search results to be contextual to where they searched from and developing new pages for search terms common to many tasks and institutions. 

To learn more about how we have been helping Canadians find the right contact when they search for contact information, see [Developing the contact us approach on Canada.ca]().
