We had some interesting results in a recent usability study that told us something about how people perceive content based on its age. This might influence how we present the date updated on Canada.ca.

## How we present the age of content

Currently, there are two main ways to how up-to-date content is on Canada.ca. One is in a standard place on each page:

[img - screenshot showing date modified on some typical Canada.ca page]

Since it's in the same place on every Government of Canada web page, people can count on finding it if they're wondering about when the page was last updated. 

The second place the date appears is in the search engine results. Both on Google:

[img - google serp with date highlighted]

...and on the Canada.ca search:

[img - Canada.ca serp with date highlighted]

In design guidance for Canada.ca, we say that you should:

"Use the date modified component to provide a person with the date that the content was last updated."

* (Headers, footers and navigation for Canada.ca)[https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/headers-footers-navigation.html#toc3]

Typically, that gets updated when there's a substantial change - not just fixing a typo, but something that actually changes the content. 

## How that influences people

People really notice the age of the content presented. Some topics aren't expected to be updated very frequently, but a subject like vaccinations while pregnant seemed to some people like something that should be updated more frequently. 

Watch a video of a usability test participant finding that the information they were looking for was more than 2 years old:
