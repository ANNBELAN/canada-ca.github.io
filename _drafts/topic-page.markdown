One of our principles was to make it while also giving them the chance to offramp to most requested tasks and explore more about government policy or opportunities to provide feedback.

Another difficulty we ran into was ensuring Canadians who were very familiar with keywords in a government process could still find their task. There was a big difference, for example, between a first time tax filer or a Canadian who knew they needed to get a TD1, one of Canada.ca's top search terms.

*Insert graphic on sections of the topic page - perhaps similar to the IP one Manu made? Maybe use a mobile view?*
*or screen grabs of the initial prototypes - might be in the usability testing report*
, we were split between trying to reduce the number of pages a user had to go through and making sure each step and label was effortless to choose.

We developed the topic page template as a standard design that could be used across the website for navigation, then we invited Canadians to try finding their tasks in the new pages.
