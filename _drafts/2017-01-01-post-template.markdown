\[This template is meant for articles that summarize issues and solutions from the usability testing we've done on Canada.ca - use in conjunction with the spreadsheet that documents issues from usability tests - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qmlBb7JbXl1KjM3Y5N4s638pupz1-MsBnMUYUGfwNLQ/edit?usp=sharing \]

Add introduction here - context on the scenario, template or pattern - indicate the user need. Max 2-3 (?) sentences.

## Usability issue

Include a succinct description of the problem (column c) and contributing factors (column d). Reference the usability testing: include clips where possible (column i). Where possible, cite any task findability or task completion %s or #s that quantify the issue (may need to go back to the reports again to pull these). Max 2-3 (?) paragraphs.

## Solution

Describe what we did in response (usually a mix of column e and column h). If changes to the Content and IA Specification have been published, provide the link, otherwise mention that it’s coming (columns j, k, l). Max 2-3 (?) paragraphs.

## Design recommendation

Single-sentence summary - use this kind of structure: When you’re building \[template or pattern\], this \[restate the change\] should help address \[restate the problem\].
