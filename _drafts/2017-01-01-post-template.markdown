\[This template is for articles that summarize issues and solutions from the usability testing we've done on Canada.ca - use in conjunction with the spreadsheet that documents issues from usability tests - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qmlBb7JbXl1KjM3Y5N4s638pupz1-MsBnMUYUGfwNLQ/edit?usp=sharing \]

Add introduction here - context on the scenario, template or pattern - indicate the user need. Max 2-3 (?) sentences.

## Usability issue

Include a succinct description of the problem (column c) and contributing factors (column d). Reference the usability testing: include clips where possible (column i). Where possible, cite any task findability or task completion %s or #s that quantify the issue (may need to go back to the reports again to pull these). Max 2-3 (?) paragraphs.

<!--- To embed a video from Youtube, just grab the embed code and paste in your doc - like in this example --->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvFE-49NYYE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<!-- when citing data, draw attention to it with a callout - use WET CSS for styling wells, as in this example -->
<div class="well panel">Only 43% of the 20 participants in our baseline usability test could solve the task.</div>

## Solution

Describe what we did in response (usually a mix of column e and column h). If changes to the Content and IA Specification have been published, provide the link, otherwise mention that it’s coming (columns j, k, l). Max 2-3 (?) paragraphs.

<!--- to insert an image, upload the picture file to the images folder, then reference it using the following syntax --->
<img class="img-responsive" alt="Sample placeholder image" src="/images/sample-echantillon-685x458px.png">

## Design recommendation

Single-sentence summary - use this kind of structure: When you’re building \[template or pattern\], this \[restate the change\] should help address \[restate the problem\].
