It can be hard to keep track of all of the digital content an institution produces. Managing by tasks is a way to focus attention on what's most important - how people use that content. This article describes how Government of Canada institutions can gather their top tasks and use them to manage their content. 

## What we mean by a task
 
A task is basically what someone wants to do. For example, some typical tasks might be: 

* renew my passport
* find out when vaccinations are needed
* get insurance for my crops

These are the kinds of tasks we want to identify and help support.

The nice thing about tasks is that it forces you to think in terms of what the visitor wants to get done. It shifts the focus from the organization (who might want to publish something), to the visitor (who needs to learn something, access a service, or apply for something). 

That doesn't guarantee success of course. But it puts you in the right position to manage content in a way that focuses on the people who use it. 

## Where organizations can get their tasks

Gerry McGovern has a detailed method for collecting and understanding an organization's top tasks. But it can be hard to follow this method when your organization is so broad. However, check The Stranger's Long Neck provides a detailed description of how you can collect and rank your top tasks, which you can certainly follow. Other options include:

Mandates and departmental plans

In the Government of Canada, we're lucky to have very clear guidance as to exactly what departments and agencies are supposed to do. These come in the form of departmental plans and mandates. There are also mandate letters sent by the Prime Minister to each of the cabinet ministers detailing some specific goals they are meant to accomplish.  

Each task you identify should be directly attributable to one of the department's priorities in the departmental plan or mandate letter. If it isn't, it's probably not a task you should be supporting. 

Call-centre and support

These are the people who hear from people the most often. Every institution has some sort of contact address or phone number. The people who respond to those requests are a gold mine of information about the people your website supports. 

This can help you understand the priority of the tasks (assuming a high volume is higher priority). They can also help you identify gaps in the tasks you've thought you've collected.

Your existing content and analytics

This is probably the easiest way to identify tasks, though you should keep in mind that it may not be entirely accurate. (Just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's a top task, and vice versa). However, you can actually get a pretty good idea of what might currently be top tasks for an organization just by looking at what the top pages are, and determining what tasks those pages support. 

Even here you have to be careful of course. Just because a page is popular doesn't mean it's a top task. For example, at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, one of the top pages was the "Maladies de vignes", or "Vine diseases". It presented information about diseases affecting grapes. We found that most of the visitors were from France, and determined that it was people trying to identify and deal with diseases affecting their grapes. 

Now that page was effective. It was well written, included useful photos, and presented useful information to people. And it was popular, being one of the top pages on the site. However, you still couldn't call that a top task of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. In fact, while the page still exists, it's archived now because they determined that it wasn't content that the department of Agriculture needed to maintain. 

Surveys

Some departments run annual or biannual exit surveys to get some information about the people who visit their sites. A useful question to ask on this kind of survey is "What did you come to the site to do?". The information this provides can be overwhelming - it'll be hard to process and categorize. But you may learn a great deal about what people are actually coming to your site to do. 

Interviews and other research

Talking directly to the people your department serves will almost always yield useful insights. Even if you're among the target audience for your department, there will always be people who have a different perspective and different needs. The more exposure you have to people, the better your understanding of what your organization should be trying to accomplish. 

What kinds of tasks should you not collect

Some types of tasks aren't distinct to your organization, and really are the same for every organization. This includes things like contacting someone, looking for a job at the organization, and applying for programs. These are key tasks of course, but they're not useful to record as top tasks for your organization since they're not distinct. We tend to address these common tasks in common ways - contact through the institutional profile and "Contact" link in the footer, etc. 

You can still collect these of course, and use them within your organization. But you don't need to report such tasks to TBS, and you may not have to manage them either since they're likely to be addressed in a standard way. 

Writing the task at the right level

One of the hard things about writing tasks is putting them at a level that's useful. And this is really the deciding factor in what level you should situate your tasks at. Is it useful? 

As an example, suppose you're listing the tasks for your organization as a whole. Depending on the breadth of the mandate of the organization, you might need to go a little bit broader in your task descriptions. For example, an organization like the Parole Board of Canada has very discrete offerings to the public:

Apply for a record suspension

Of course there are associated tasks around that, including learning what record suspensions are, finding out who's eligible, and the like. They may also have an additional role in pro

They do more than this of course, but these are really the core 

Organizations with no or very few tasks 

You might even have an institution with no tasks that can be accessed by the public. Shared Services Canada may fall into that category. For them, the only public tasks are likely to be related to finding out what the department does. That's OK! Having a lot of public tasks doesn't say anything about how important an organization is across the government. And resisting the urge to describe what every organization does can help reduce the number of little-used pages there are on the web. 

How many tasks you'll collect

This is a typical "it depends" question. The
