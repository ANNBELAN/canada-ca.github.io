Canada.ca brings together the services and information that people need from dozens of departments and agencies in the Government of Canada. Even departments sometimes have trouble keeping track of the different services, guides and regulations they manage. Measuring how well we're delivering what citizens need across the whole government is no small challenge.

Fortunately, we don't need to know every single possible task that people are doing to help Canadians. By focusing on the tasks that are used by the most people, we can refine content and information architecture to make those top tasks easier to find and complete.

That's why we've compiled a [top 100 tasks list for the Government of Canada]().

## Encouraging top task management across Government
 
Top task management isn't new to the Government of Canada. Even before Canada.ca and the first compilation of top tasks across the Government of Canada in 2013, a number of departments were experimenting with top task management and different methods to identify tasks including from analytics, service inventories to top task surveys.

We've been focusing on
a) making sure all departments and agencies have the know-how to identify their own top tasks
b) compiling the top 100 tasks with comparable data across departments and agencies

Since 2013, we've gone through 3 iterations of the top task list for Canada.ca, improving, as a government, how we can gather comparable data and tasks. 

For more on how we've been asking departments and agencies to think about and provide us comparable top task data, please read [How to identify top tasks]().

## Top task stages



We've put together a three phase approach to top task management on Canada.ca:

*Visual on the three stages*

- collecting analytics
- refining the list
- survey


## 1. Use visits to rank tasks

Since 2013, we've focused on the first two stages. These were the top 3 challenges we've been trying to overcome in data collection:

**Analytics comparability:** sampled data from free analytics softwares, server logs analytics only available in certain time periods and unavailability of visits data have been some of the issues we've had in collecting comparable data

**Visits vs pageviews:** even though it's sometimes harder to track and report on, we've moved away from pageviews data since it can inflate some tasks that have pages with a search interface

**Start pages vs all pages:** although some tasks are accessed on many different pages, the weather forecast, for instance, we've moved away from rolling up analytics for many pages related to a task. We now focus on gathering analytics data with 1 start page per task

The latest version of the top tasks is ranked based on:
- unique page visits
- by task start page
- combined English and French data

## 2. Find the right level of task

Although each department and agency is able to complete stage 1 by using comparable metrics and analysing the different things Canadians are doing with them, when we're comparing the tasks, we need to figure out core tasks and their supporting sub-tasks.

For example, “Get a passport” is a popular task. There might be a lot of tasks behind that. It  could include things like “renew a passport”, “see passport photo requirements”; even down to “download the passport renewal form". If you were working on the passport content, then you’d want to keep track of all of these tasks. But for our government-wide view, “get a passport” is enough. 
 
We wrote each task as a verb, to make clearer what people are trying to do. We could have simply used "Canadian passports", but wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?"
 
That doesn't necessarily mean that this is how you should write link labels on your site! “Passports” is a perfectly good navigation label to use to bring people to the section of the site where they can do everything about passports - including getting one. 

We collected hundreds of tasks, but picked out 100 of the most visited tasks to make the current top task list. 

## 3. Validating the tasks and filling in the gaps

We're pretty confident in our latest set of 100 top tasks, so we're now looking to start stage 3: top task surveys.

The Canada Revenue Agency has already launched a survey on their Canada.ca pages to ask visitors which tasks they came to do.

By asking Canadians, we can get a much higher level of confidence that the tasks we've identified are actually what people came to do. The surveys also allow for respondents to identify other tasks that we might have missed.

Over the next year, we're planning to work with departments and agencies to implement similar top task surveys and further mature our top task approach.

## Managing tasks

But 

In addition to visits, we keep track of some of the details about tasks in the list:

## From identifying tasks to change for Canadians

Tasks are used to inform policy decisions, make design and layout updates on the web and break down silos to improve service delivery.




Government services can be hard to define. 



Canadians often have to go beyond the website when they complete their tasks with government, such as going to a Service Canada office or sending an application by mail to renew a passport. 

Some services aren't even associated with government by many Canadians. The Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP), for instance is almost entirely managed by banks where citizens can apply for them, but is provided under a government policy.

Even online, authenticated accounts or 

there are accounts and databases where citizens and clients need to do something beyond Canada.ca. 

<!--
questions to answer
what exactly are tasks? how are they different from services? what about the sub-tasks and offline tasks that are important?
what does task management allow us to accomplish?
how do we manage canada.ca performance by what the user is trying to do?
-->







Over the past 4 years, we've also gone through 3 different iterations of the top task list, trying to improve our methodology and communications each year. 


Some institutions have been doing task analysis conducted exercises to determine their top tasks even before Canada.ca was started in 2013, and among them, some departments even use mature top task collection techniques such as user surveys.

Bringing these departments and agencies less experienced with top task management together, to discuss how they could build a site together for Canadians and was the first step 

to the same table, to discover how those tasks fit together was one of the objectives of setting up Theme Leads for Canada.ca.

there are a lot of departments and agencies in the government, many of which don't even 

, some even going beyond analytics and using surveys to get a good picture of their user needs. 






 
## Next steps
 
We're already using the list to help us plan and prioritize upcoming task-based optimization projects. It also feeds into overall Canada.ca optimization, both at the theme level and above. We want to keep this list evergreen, constantly refining it as we learn more about what people are coming to Canada.ca to do. To that end, we’ll continue to collect this data from institutions across government. 
 
We also want to help institutions collect and manage their own top tasks. Most institutions have a good idea of the content they produce, often down to the page level. But they may not always be sure that the content is actually supporting a task. The next phase of our work will be to help institutions in collecting and tracking their own tasks so they can be used to manage their content.
