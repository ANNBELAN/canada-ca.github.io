Canada.ca brings together the services and information that people need from dozens of departments and agencies in the Government of Canada. Even departments sometimes have trouble keeping track of the different services, guides and regulations they manage. Measuring how well we're delivering what citizens need across the whole government is no small challenge.

Fortunately, we don't need to know every single possible task that people are doing to help Canadians. By focusing on the tasks that are used by the most people, we can refine content and information architecture to make those top tasks easier to find and complete.

That's why we've compiled a [top 100 tasks list for the Government of Canada]().

## Encouraging top task management across Government
 
Top task management isn't new to the Government of Canada. Even before Canada.ca and the first compilation of top tasks across the Government of Canada in 2013, a number of departments were experimenting with top task management.

Now, we're focusing on
a) making sure all departments and agencies identify their top tasks
b) compiling the top 100 tasks with comparable data across departments and agencies

## Top task stages



We've put together a three phase approach to top task management on Canada.ca:

*Visual on the three stages*

- collecting analytics
- refining the list
- survey

## 1. Use visits to rank tasks

Since 2013, we've focused on the first two stages. These were the top 3 challenges we've been trying to overcome in data collection:

**Analytics comparability:** sampled data from free analytics softwares, server logs analytics only available in certain time periods and unavailability of visits data have been some of the issues we've had in collecting comparable data

**Visits vs pageviews:** even though it's sometimes harder to track and report on, we've moved away from pageviews data since it can inflate some tasks that have pages with a search interface

**Start pages vs all pages:** although some tasks are accessed on many different pages, the weather forecast, for instance, we've moved away from rolling up analytics for many pages related to a task. We now focus on gathering analytics data with 1 start page per task

The latest version of the top tasks is ranked based on:
- unique page visits
- by task start page
- combined English and French data

In addition to visit metrics, we've also been keeping track of mobile visits for tasks.

## 2. Find the right level of task

Although each department and agency is able to complete stage 1 by using comparable metrics and analysing the different things Canadians are doing with them, when we're comparing the tasks, we need to figure out core tasks and their supporting sub-tasks.

For example, “Get a passport” is a popular task. There might be a lot of tasks behind that. It  could include things like “renew a passport”, “see passport photo requirements”; even down to “download the passport renewal form". If you were working on the passport content, then you’d want to keep track of all of these tasks. But for our government-wide view, “get a passport” is enough. 
 
We wrote each task as a verb, to make clearer what people are trying to do. We could have simply used "Canadian passports", but wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?"
 
That doesn't necessarily mean that this is how you should write link labels on your site! “Passports” is a perfectly good navigation label to use to bring people to the section of the site where they can do everything about passports - including getting one. 

We collected hundreds of tasks, but picked out 100 of the most visited tasks to make the current top task list. 

Since 2013, we've gone through 3 iterations of the top task list for Canada.ca, improving, as a government, how we can gather comparable data and tasks.

## 3. Validating the tasks and filling in the gaps

We're pretty confident in our latest set of 100 top tasks, so we're now looking to start stage 3: top task surveys.

The team at TBS isn't always the trailblazer. Many departments and collaborators are continuing on their traditions of top task management and putting new techniques into practice.

The Canada Revenue Agency has already launched a survey on their Canada.ca pages to ask visitors which tasks they came to do.

By asking Canadians, we can get a much higher level of confidence that the tasks we've identified are actually what people came to do. The surveys also allow for respondents to identify other tasks that we might have missed.

Over the next year, we're planning to work with CRA and other departments and agencies to implement similar top task surveys and further mature our top task approach.

## Change for Canadians

Why all the effort identifying tasks?

Top task performance is now being used as the basis for optimizing Canada.ca. 

Top task management is not about migrating all content to new platforms, removing old, duplicate content or even managing your web presence. These all have their place and time, but the priority of all communications branches in government needs to be focused on ensuring citizens are able to find and complete the tasks they come to do. If we don't, we are putting at risk the outcomes of the policies and services that our government is mandated to deliver.

And the web isn't the end. TBS is also planning to leverage top tasks to inform service policy. Top tasks currently only reflect the online portion of tasks, but we're collaborating to make sure the dots are connected with call centers, service desks and the other ways government serves Canadians.
