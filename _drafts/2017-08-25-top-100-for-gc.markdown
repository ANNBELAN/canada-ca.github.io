<!-- Goals

* help understand why we're collecting top tasks
** How does it make things better for people?
* what exactly are tasks? how are they different from services? what about the sub-tasks and offline tasks that are important?
* how do we manage canada.ca performance by what the user is trying to do?

-->

Canada.ca brings together services and information from all across the Government of Canada. To be effective, Canada.ca needs to deliver what people need. People have to be able to accomplish what they came to the site to do. We call the things they came to do their **tasks**.

The Government of Canada supports a huge number of tasks, and individual departments and agencies have to manage all of them. But from a government-wide view, we focus on the "top" tasks. These are the most important and most used tasks across the government. By focusing on top tasks, we can make the site work better for most people.

To help with this, we've compiled a [top 100 tasks list for the Government of Canada](https://canada-ca.github.io/pages/top-task-list-canada-ca.html).

## Top tasks form the basis for Canada.ca

Top task management isn't new to the Government of Canada. In 2013, We compiled the first government-wide top task list to help design Canada.ca. And even earlier, several departments were experimenting with top task management for their own sites.

Since 2013, we've gone through 3 major iterations of the top task list for Canada.ca. Each time we've improved how we gather comparable data and tasks.

## How we compiled the list

We put together a three-phase approach to top task management on Canada.ca:

### 1. Collecting the top task data

The first step was to collect top task data. We started with the institutions with the most popular content on Canada.ca. Some of the sources for this data included:

* web analytics 
* Departmental plans
* Mandate letters (from the Prime Minister to cabinet ministers)
* feedback or call centre reports
* input from people who manage programs
* Input from the staff working with the public
* past research or surveys

#### Challenges when collecting data from different sources

There are some challenges in trying to collect data from so many different sources. They include:

<b>Analytics comparability:</b> There's a wide variety of web analytics in use, some more effective than others. Some free analytics software only samples data. Some track effectively, but is very inefficient for getting reports.

<b>Visits versus pageviews:</b> Visits tend to better represent a real person completing a task than pageviews. Pageview numbers can sometimes be inflated when a task involves multiple pages.

<b>Start pages versus all pages:</b> Some tasks require a visitor to go to several different pages, while others can be accomplished on one page. We've moved away from combining traffic for many pages related to a task to try to keep them comparable. We now try to identify and track one start page per task.

### 2. Analyzing and ranking the tasks

When comparing tasks from widely different departments and agencies, we need to separate core tasks from their supporting sub-tasks.

For example, “Get a passport” is a popular task. But to actually accomplish the goal of getting a passport, you'll have to do a number of steps. We call these smaller steps "sub-tasks". For instance:

- see if you're eligible to get a passport
- check passport photo requirements
- download the passport request form

If you were a content designer working on passports, then you’d need to keep track of all of these sub-tasks. But for our purposes, “Get a passport” provided enough detail to help us manage the task at the central agency level.

We could have named the task "Canadian passports", but wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?" So we wrote each task as a verb, to make clearer what people are trying to do. 

Once the core tasks were identified, we ranked them based on visits to the start pages. This gave us a sense of how often each task is actually used. It continues to help us tell where improving tasks could have the greatest impact.

### 3. Validating the top tasks with website visitors

Once tasks have been identified, analyzed, and ranked, we need to validate them with website visitors. This will include asking people why they came to the site. They can choose from the tasks we identified or add their own reason. This way we can fill in any gaps, which will give us greater confidence that the tasks we've identified are actually what people come to do.

Over the next year, we're planning to work with departments and agencies on these top task surveys and further mature our approach to top tasks. 

## How top tasks will change service delivery

Top task performance is the basis for optimizing Canada.ca. We're also planning to use top tasks to inform overall service delivery. Right now, our top tasks reflect the online portion of tasks, but we're also working with service providers to make sure task improvements are connected with all the ways government serves the public.
