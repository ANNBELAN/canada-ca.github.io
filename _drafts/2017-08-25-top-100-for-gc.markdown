Canada.ca brings together the services and information that people need from dozens of departments and agencies in the Government of Canada. Even departments sometimes have trouble keeping track of the different services, guides and regulations they manage, so to understand if we're delivering what citizens need is no small challenge.

Fortunately, we don't need to know every single possible task that people are doing to help Canadians. If we understand which tasks are used by the most people, we can focus on refining content and information architecture to make those top tasks easier to find and complete.

That's why we've compiled a [top 100 tasks list for the Government of Canada]().

## What is a Canada.ca task?



<!--
questions to answer
what exactly are tasks? how are they different from services? what about the sub-tasks and offline tasks that are important?
what does task management allow us to accomplish?
how do we manage canada.ca performance by what the user is trying to do?

A task is, basically, what someone wants to do. For example, some typical tasks might be: 

* renew my passport
* find out when vaccinations are needed
* get insurance for my crops

These are the kinds of tasks we want to identify and help support. Something you don't need to track is something like:

* View a video
* Download a publication
* View frequently asked questions

These aren't things that people are looking to do, but might be something that they do to support a task. 

"Tasks" could just as easily be called "goals" - the term isn't important. The important thing is that it be a realistic depiction of what people are actually trying to do, and written at a level that's useful in managing content. 

The nice thing about tasks is that it forces you to think in terms of what the visitor wants to get done. It shifts the focus from the organization (who might want to publish something), to the visitor (who needs to learn something, access a service, or apply for something). 

That doesn't guarantee success but it puts you in the right position to manage content in a way that focuses on the people who use it.

Government services can be hard to define. 



Canadians often have to go beyond the website when they complete their tasks with government, such as going to a Service Canada office or sending an application by mail to renew a passport. 

Some services aren't even associated with government by many Canadians. The Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP), for instance is almost entirely managed by banks where citizens can apply for them, but is provided under a government policy.

Even online, authenticated accounts or 

there are accounts and databases where citizens and clients need to do something beyond Canada.ca. 



 
## What we collected

The core information we collected included:


 
### Where people "start" the task
 
In previous versions of the list, we found that some tasks seemed to have an unusually high number of visits. This might be because there were a lot of pages associated with a task, or because the task involved a search interface that reported separately for every search result. To avoid complications from these issues, we instead focused on the page where most people tend to start the task. 

### A sense of the traffic
 
Once we have a start page, we wanted to get a sense of how much traffic the page gets. This isn't necessarily a strong indicator of how important a task is. It's possible that something is a top task, but people have a hard time finding it. 

### Search terms people use to get to the task
 
Search logs provide a view into what people are thinking when they visit a website. They also show how often people look for particular things. If you can tell what terms people used to get to the top tasks, then you can refine the related content to make that path even easier for people. 

See [Search-Log Analysis: The Most Overlooked Opportunity in Web UX Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-log-analysis/) for tips on why and how to analyze search log data.

### Top requests to call centres

Call centres get to talk directly to the people using government services. If we know what issues the call centre hears about, we get a good sense of what’s important to people.  

Again, just because an issue comes to a call centre a lot doesn’t mean it’s a top task. For example, one of the most common questions Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada gets is whether dogs are allowed on the [Central Experimental Farm](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/offices-and-locations/central-experimental-farm/?id=1170701489551). Important information for some, but not a top task for the department. 
 
### Proportion of mobile visits
 
We have a good view of how many people are visiting Canada.ca with mobile devices, but not how that proportion varies from task to task. This data provides a useful view into where some tasks remain solidly on the desktop, and which tend to be accessed more through mobile devices.

## Analyzing the results
 
Once we had the data, it was just a matter of digging through to make the list. A big part of this work was identifying a core task and its supporting sub-tasks. 

For example, “Get a passport” is a popular task. There might be a lot of tasks behind that. It  could include things like “renew a passport”, “see passport photo requirements”; even down to “download the passport renewal form". If you were working on the passport content, then you’d want to keep track of all of these tasks. But for our government-wide view, “get a passport” is enough. 
 
We wrote each task as a verb, to make clearer what people are trying to do. We could have simply used "Canadian passports", but wanted to keep the tasks as answers to the question, "why are people coming to the site?"
 
That doesn't necessarily mean that this is how you should write link labels on your site! “Passports” is a perfectly good navigation label to use to bring people to the section of the site where they can do everything about passports - including getting one. 

We collected hundreds of tasks, but picked out 100 of the most visited tasks to make the current top task list. 
 
## Next steps
 
We're already using the list to help us plan and prioritize upcoming task-based optimization projects. It also feeds into overall Canada.ca optimization, both at the theme level and above. We want to keep this list evergreen, constantly refining it as we learn more about what people are coming to Canada.ca to do. To that end, we’ll continue to collect this data from institutions across government. 
 
We also want to help institutions collect and manage their own top tasks. Most institutions have a good idea of the content they produce, often down to the page level. But they may not always be sure that the content is actually supporting a task. The next phase of our work will be to help institutions in collecting and tracking their own tasks so they can be used to manage their content.
