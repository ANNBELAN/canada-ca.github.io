Canada.ca was created to make online services simpler and easier for Canadians. Since 2014, the Canada.ca team at TBS has been working with departments and User Experience (UX) designers and researchers on how best to treat frequently used services in the Canada.ca design. Now the focus is on measuring and improving online success on those top tasks. These optimization projects follow a process we've designed to deliver the most impact on ease of use in the shortest amount of time. 

## Optimization design sprints

To improve existing digital services for citizens, the TBS optimization team draws on our own experience along with methods adapted from Google Ventures, Gerry McGovern, and from the other governments such as the Government Digital Services team in the UK. We use these ideas together with GC departments to improve top tasks like starting a business, getting weather information and visiting Canada.

Optimization projects are short and intensely focused on increasing task success. We concentrate on improving the first steps that citizens would take to explore and understand the task. For example, to start a business, people needed to understand the sequence they would need to follow, and explore the implications before they took a particular step. As we build up our experience working on optimization, we anticipate working deeper and deeper into the tasks. 

## Thinking through improving task success

Data and evidence drive the 3 to 4 month sequence we use to optimize online services:

1. **Discovery research** - gather and synthesize existing evidence into insights and hypotheses to produce scenarios for the testing
2. **Baseline testing** - moderated usability research with Canadians who attempt the scenarios on the existing website
3. **Design and prototyping** - sprints to iteratively design, build and test a prototype website to solve the problems seen in discovery & baseline testing
4. **Validation testing** - repeat the baseline test on the new prototype site across the same scenarios with a different but similar set of Canadian participants 
5. **Launching prototypes** - assuming the validation test shows a measurable improvement, integrate and release the successful aspects of the prototypes at the earliest opportunity.

## Successful task teams are multi-disciplinary

Once an optimization project is agreed upon, the optimization team is formed with members from TBS and from the department(s) responsible for the service. TBS optimization members include an experienced Optimization Lead, with designers, behavioural researchers, project managers and advisors.  From the departments, members usually include web communications leads and program specialists.  Teams may occasionally pull in deeper-level specialists. For example, an expert from Corporations Canada joined the starting a business optimization team to workshop the baseline testing results, and afterwards were represented by ISED. As the project ramps up into the design and prototyping stage, the team works together through frequent face-to-face workshops and online tools like Github and Webex.

## Usability testing is key

You'll notice that two of the steps in the process involve moderated usability testing. In fact, usability testing is key to the success of the entire project.

Through moderated usability testing, we are attempting to accomplish two things:

 - measure improvements in terms of task findability and task completion
 - leverage evidence to guide our improvement activities.

In terms of measuring improvements, we are aiming to achieve a noticeable increase in participants' ability to both find and complete the tasks. Usually, this means something in the range of 10 to 20 percentage points when comparing the baseline testing results to the validation round, depending on where the baseline sits. It's a lot easier to go from from 50% to 70% task success in a single project than it is to go from 70% to 90%. 

Within each optimization project, the insights that the team gains from observing usability testing and analyzing the results feed directly into the design phase. It's only once the baseline testing is completed that we actually know what to focus on in terms of building the prototypes.

The insights drawn from usability testing are also leveraged to improve the overall design system for Canada.ca. We're always looking for patterns in the issues that the testing uncovers, and when we spot a trend, we work on updating our design manuals to address them. You'll see evidence of this in updates to the [Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification](link) and [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](link).

## There's more to come

To date we have undertaken two Canada.ca optimization projects, and we're working on more. We'll be writing up our experiences with these activities in future articles, so stay tuned!
