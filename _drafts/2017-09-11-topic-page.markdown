Over 2012 and 2013, top task research for Canada.ca helped us build a theme and topic taxonomy that we had evidence helped Canadians find the services and information they came to government websites to find. Ever since, we've been making improvements to how we display that taxonomy in topic pages.

## Building blocks for Canada.ca

The topic page was the first the building block templates on Canada.ca. By that, we mean it was a standard layout that could be reused by all of the 15 themes, their lead departments and collaborating institutions to create a navigation layer at highest level of Canada.ca.

Canada.ca and its themes and topics were developed based on mental models of Canadians, based on evidence from research and testing that we've summarised in the [Canada.ca themes and topics article]().

## Topic page design

One of the principles we started out with was to ensure that the theme or topic gave the next level down in navigation labels, while also giving shortcuts to top tasks. In addition, there are policies, consultations and data that, while not for the majority of users, might be relevant to some experts and professionals who want to explore the topic further.

This opportunity to offramp was designed in the "most requested services and information" block.




Another difficulty we ran into was ensuring Canadians who were very familiar with keywords in a government process could still find their task. There was a big difference, for example, between a first time tax filer or a Canadian who knew they needed to get a TD1, one of Canada.ca's top search terms.

*Insert graphic on sections of the topic page - perhaps similar to the IP one Manu made? Maybe use a mobile view?*
*or screen grabs of the initial prototypes - might be in the usability testing report*
, we were split between trying to reduce the number of pages a user had to go through and making sure each step and label was effortless to choose.

We developed the topic page template as a standard design that could be used across the website for navigation, then we invited Canadians to try finding their tasks in the new pages.
