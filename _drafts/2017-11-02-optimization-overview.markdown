Canada.ca has always been about making online services simpler and easier for Canadians. 
In designing the site, the Digital Transformation Office at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) started off looking at top tasks in general, but now we we’re going into specifics. The focus is now on measuring and improving citizens’ online success for top tasks through optimization projects. We’ve designed a process that delivers the most impact on ease of use in the shortest amount of time.

## Optimization projects: improving specific top tasks

To improve existing digital services for citizens, we continue to draw on our own experience and expert sources. We’ve adapted a lot of methods from leaders in the field like Gerry McGovern and Jake Knapp.  The experience of other governments including the Government Digital Services team in the United Kingdom has been very useful. These are the sources that we’ve drawn on to work departments to improve top tasks like starting a business, getting weather information and visiting Canada.

Optimization projects are short and intensely focused on increasing success for a specific top task. They typically last 3 to 4 months. We focus on the first steps that citizens would take to explore and understand the task. For example, to start a business, people needed to understand the order they might follow. They also needed to explore the possible outcomes before they take certain steps. As we build up our experience working on optimization, we will expand beyond finding and starting tasks into task completion.   

## Methodology for improving task success

Data and evidence drive the 3 to 4 month sequence that we are using to optimize online services:

1. **Discovery research**: the existing evidence is gathered and synthesized into insights and hypotheses to produce scenarios for baseline testing
2. **Baseline testing**: moderated usability tests are done with Canadians trying the scenarios on the existing website
3. **Design and prototyping**: sprints are used to iteratively design, build and test a prototype website that solves the problems seen in discovery and baseline testing
4. **Benchmark testing**: the baseline test (usability testing) is repeated on the new prototype site with a different but similar set of Canadian participants 
5. **Prototype launch**: if the validation test shows a measurable improvement, then the successful aspects of the prototypes are integrated and released at the earliest opportunity.

## Successful task teams are multi-disciplinary

Once an optimization project is agreed upon, an optimization team is formed with members from TBS and from the department(s) responsible for the service. TBS members include an experienced optimization lead, designers, behavioural researchers, project managers and advisors. Members from the departments usually include web communications leads and program specialists.

Teams may occasionally pull in deeper-level specialists. For example, an expert from Corporations Canada joined the “starting a business” optimization team to workshop the baseline testing results. Corporations Canada then stepped back and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada represented them moving forward. As the project ramps up into the design and prototyping stage, the team works together through frequent face-to-face workshops and online tools like Github and Webex.

## Usability testing is key

You'll notice that 2 of the steps in the process involve moderated usability testing. In fact, usability testing is key to the success of the entire project. The research is done with Canadian participants from across the country performing realistic task-scenarios on their own computers, tablets and phones. This kind of research study gives the team valuable measurements of how well the service is performing, and helps them understand how people are using the content on the site.  

Through moderated usability testing, we gain 2 things:

1.	measureable improvements in terms of task findability and task completion
2. 2.	evidence we can leverage to further guide our improvement activities

In terms of measuring improvements, we are aiming for a big increase in the participants' ability to both find and complete tasks. Before and after tests often show gains of between 10 and 20 percentage points. However, the higher your baseline testing results, the harder it is to improve task success in a single project. 

The insights that the team gains from observing people performing tasks during usability testing and analyzing the results feed directly into the design phase. It's only once the baseline testing is completed that we actually know what to focus on as potential solutions to build into the prototypes. 

The insights drawn from usability testing are also leveraged to improve the overall design system for Canada.ca. We're always looking for patterns in the issues that testing uncovers. When we spot a trend, we work on updating our design manuals to address them. You'll see evidence of this in updates to the:

## Documenting our experiences

To date we have undertaken 2 Canada.ca optimization projects, and we're working on more. We'll be writing up our experiences with these activities in future articles, so stay tuned!
